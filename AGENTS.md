# Repository guidance

## Secret gate before publication

Before publishing the current PR branch, commit the complete candidate and run
`python3 scripts/secret_gate.py` (native Windows: `python`). Require exit 0;
missing tooling/authentication, scan errors and skipped scans block publication.
Then run the existing repository gates. Repeat after changing outgoing commits.
Push exactly the scanned HEAD. This PR scan covers the current branch against its
fetched intended base; other refs, multi-ref pushes and rewritten history require
`--pre-push` with Git's complete ref-update stream. Stop if any pushed ref is
uncovered. See [secret scanning](SECRET-SCANNING.md) for base selection, new branches,
pre-push input and prerequisites. Preserve GitGuardian App, CI and Gitleaks checks.

Local tooling: `make pre-push`.
